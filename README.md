# ELM voting workshop

ELM version of the voting workshop. The goal is to complete the voting application, a user need to be able to:
- Display all the voting options
- Vote for an option
- See in realtime the update of any vote (using websocket)

We left some TODO comment all over the application for you to complete in order to make it working

ELM files:
```
src/Main.elm
src/app
```
